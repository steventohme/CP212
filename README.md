# Final VBA project for CP212 - Windows Application Programming.

We were assigned to make a program that assessed and graphed data from an outside database. This excel file once 
run can perform a multitude of tasks. It can show all student grades sorted by any category that they have listed. 
When student grades are sorted it will also create graphs of the standard deviation, max & min, etc. The program 
can also create a word document with the information it collects if this option is selected.
